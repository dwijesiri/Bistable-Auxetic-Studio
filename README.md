# Bistable Auxetic Studio

__

## Overview:

A lightweight application to create Bistable Auxetic Surfaces, programmed in pure python, with an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). Patterns can be exported as .SVG files for lasercutting and take the form of .baux files.

## Credits:

This program is based off the paper: 'Bistable Auxetic Surface Structures' by Tian Chen, Julian Panetta, Max Schnaubelt and Mark Pauly, though there is no personal or proffessional affiliation with them.
